    <p>MoneyLink Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy</p>
    <p>Last Updated: March 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      MoneyLink is committed to protecting users, especially minors, from any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform. We enforce strict policies and employ industry-standard safety measures to prevent, detect, and remove CSAE content while cooperating with law enforcement agencies and child protection organizations worldwide.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Zero-Tolerance Policy</h2>
    <p>
      MoneyLink maintains a zero-tolerance approach towards any content or activity that promotes, enables, or involves child sexual abuse and exploitation. We strictly prohibit:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The sharing, posting, or transmission of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in any form.</li>
      <li>The grooming of minors for sexual exploitation.</li>
      <li>Any attempt to solicit or exploit children through our platform.</li>
      <li>Transactions linked to the distribution or promotion of CSAE content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Reporting and Response Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      We encourage all users to report any suspicious content or behavior related to CSAE immediately. MoneyLink provides multiple reporting channels:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-app reporting:</strong> Users can flag suspicious content directly within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> Reports can be sent to our dedicated team at safety@moneylink.com.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Proactive Detection and Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      To combat CSAE, MoneyLink employs advanced technology and human moderation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automated Content Scanning:</strong> We use AI-powered tools to detect and block known CSAM before it can be shared.</li>
      <li><strong>Behavioral Monitoring:</strong> Algorithms identify suspicious patterns, including grooming behavior and illicit transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Age Verification:</strong> We require valid identification for all users to ensure that minors are not using MoneyLink for unauthorized purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration with Industry Partners:</strong> We work with child protection organizations, including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other global institutions, to stay ahead of emerging threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Privacy and Child Safety</h2>
    <p>
      MoneyLink follows strict data protection policies to safeguard children from exploitation:

      <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Our platform is built to protect user identity and prevent misuse.</li>
    </ul>
